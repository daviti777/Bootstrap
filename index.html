                <p class="card-text">Today Artbat are among the most successful Ukrainian electronic acts and enjoy global recognition. Just a year after Artur and Batish, 
                                    two experienced deejays and producers from Kiev, joined their forces as Artbat, the project 
                                    has completed a rewarding transition from the debut release to performing at the Destino club, Ibiza.
                                    The key to Artbat’s success lies within their powerful and inventive sound of the highest quality. 
                                    Their tracks have an impressive capacity to fuel both intimate dancefloors and huge arenas with energy and drive.
                                     And these are just the reasons many renowned artists are attracted by Artbat’s music. Such dance music authorities like Solomun, Maceo Plex, 
                                     and Richie Hawtin regularly spin Artbat’s tracks during their sets.

                  <p class="paragrap-artbat">Since the emergence of their debut single ‘Mandrake’ Artbat’s discography has expanded to seven releases extra. Three of them appeared in the Beatport’s Techno Top 100 and their single
                     Confession’ has charted 37th in the Beatport’s Deep House Top 100. For a whole month ‘Mandrake’ remained in the Beatport Top 100 chart and has just become one of the most successful Definition:Music releases ever.
                    These remarkable achievements led Artbat to collaborations with the finest European labels like Diynamic, Suara, Parallel Records, Sincopat, 303Lovers and so on. 
                    New Artbat’s track “Uplift” was released on 17th March 2017 on Diynamic Music climbed #4 in Tech House Top 100 and #7 in Top 100 All Genres Chart on Beatport.
                    Through their releases, Artbat make it perfectly clear that this duo has single possible purpose – to headline the upcoming night party. Working their magic as creators of many a dance 
                    hit in techno and house varieties they are fire quick to drive everyone on the dance floor into the craze. Prior to coming together as Artbat, the two – Artur and Batish – gained invaluable experience as 
                    performing DJs at plenty parties at the best nightclubs in Kiev. 
                    Last year their touring outreach added a number of new concert locations such as Lebanon, Egypt, Greece, Dubai and Georgia – no wonder, Artbat’s schedule absorbs new dates at a steady pace.
                    Summer 2016 saw Artbat play Ibiza at Destino club. The guys successfully went on at Destino right after a series of trademark parties by Luciano, the godfather of Cadenza the label.
                    Now guys working a lot in studio and more releases coming this year, you can hear playing them on upcoming gigs in new season on Ibiza and all around the world.</p>

                    <p class="paragrap-adriatique">Both living in Zurich, each regularly performing as DJs, and both named Adrian S. perhaps it was inevitable that Adrian Shala and Adrian Schweizer would meet in 2008 and form a near-instant friendship. 
                      Perhaps it was destiny. But it’s the professional bond that followed for which we are so lucky, a bond that would help them ascend the dance music community as the production and DJ duo known as Adriatique.
                      But inevitabilities aside, the basis of any great partnership is how one complements the other, which in the case of the Adrians, was evident from the outset. While one had honed his musical chops with house for the US and Detroit techno, 
                      the other dwelled in deep melodies and European techno. One might gravitate toward the studio, while the other can't resist the temptation of the booth. One is blond, the other colloquially known as “dark-haired Adrian.” And it is the sum of many parts that gives us what we now know so well. 
                      In the world of dance music, where producers might spend a few nights DJing and some DJs may dabble in producing, their partnership has mastered both while bridging the perspectives of two varied backgrounds bound by the ultimate desire to forge a unique sonic signature and connect with the audience that shares in their deeply held belief that music is meditation.
                      Forging relationships with artists and labels that share in their sensibilities, Adriatique has released on Zurich's Cityfox, L.A.’s Culprit, New York’s Wolf & Lamb, London’s Supernature, Canada’s My Favorite Robot, and most frequently, Hamburg’s Diynamic, which first brought them to the forefront with “Deep in the Three."
